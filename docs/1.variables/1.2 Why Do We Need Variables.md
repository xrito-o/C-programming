## **Why Do We Need Variables?**

Without variables, you could only work with fixed values in your program (called **literals**). Variables let your program **store information and reuse it later**, which is essential for making dynamic, interactive programs.

Example without variables:

```c
printf("The number is 5");
```

Here, `5` is fixed — you can’t change it without editing the code.

Example with variables:

```c
int number = 5;
printf("The number is %d", number);
```

Now you can change `number` anywhere in the code without rewriting the whole program.
