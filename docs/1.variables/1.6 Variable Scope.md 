### **Variable Scope**

The **scope** of a variable is where in the program it can be accessed:

* **Block scope:** Inside `{ }` only.
* **Function scope:** Inside a specific function.
* **File scope:** Visible to the whole file.
* **Program scope:** Accessible by all files in a project (with `extern`).
