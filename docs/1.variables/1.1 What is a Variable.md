## **What is a Variable?**

In C programming, a **variable** is a name that refers to a specific memory location where a value is stored.
This value can be changed (varied) while the program runs, which is why it’s called a **variable**.

When you create a variable, you are essentially telling the compiler:

1. **What type of data** you want to store (e.g., number, character, decimal).
2. **What name** you want to use to refer to that data.

For example:

```c
int age = 19;     // Stores an integer
float price = 5.99; // Stores a decimal number
char grade = 'A';   // Stores a single character
```

In this example:

* `int`, `float`, and `char` are **data types**.
* `age`, `price`, and `grade` are **variable names**.
* `19`, `5.99`, and `'A'` are the **stored values**.

A variable’s **value** can change during execution:

```c
age = 20; // The value stored in 'age' is now 20
```
