## **Declaring a Variable**

In C, you must **declare** a variable before using it.
This tells the compiler two things:

1. **What kind of data** it will store (data type).
2. **What name** you want to use for it.

Syntax:

```c
<data_type> <variable_name>;
```

Example:

```c
int age;
float price;
char grade;
```

## **Initializing a Variable**

You can also **assign a value** when you declare a variable.
This is called **initialization**.

Example:

```c
int age = 19;
float price = 49.99;
char grade = 'A';
```

You can also assign values later:

```c
int age;
age = 19;
```
